# The Prediction of Customer Churn

## Problem definition

Customer churn is important because every time a client leaves, it represents a significant investment lost. Both time and effort need to be channelled into replacing them.

## Goals

To take effective action to retain the customer before it is too late by being able to predict when a client is likely to leave

## Methodology

The CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a popular methodology for increasing the success of DM projects (Chapman et al., 2000).

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The steps for exploratory Data Analysis :
* Data Quality Checking
* Descriptive Statistics
* Target Variable Distribution (Train and Test)
* Numerical Feature Distribution (Train and Test)
* Categorical Feature Distribution (Train and Test)

## Data Preprocessing
1. Data Cleaning 
    * Fill in missing values 
    * Delete duplicate data

2. Feature Encoding
    * One-hot Encoding to convert numerical categorical variables into binary vectors

3. Normalization
    * Use Min-Max Scaler to transform numerical data value by scaling into range between 0 - 1
